## SMART OKRS (SOKR) MVP BACKSTORY

[Link to Live Demo App](https://friendly-wiles-9707cf.netlify.com/)

This project was a start-up idea I had inspired by my work exerience at 15Five and IFTTT.

When I was introduced to OKRs at 15Five, it just made so much sense to me and resonated with my own goal-oriented personality.

Then, when I was introduced to the world of IoT technologies at IFTTT, I thought: what if, I could create a goal management software that integrates with all the popular software tools that tech companies regularly use like Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, etc and automate goal management?

The idea of SOKR was born to help automate goals through the everyday tools you use daily.

This is accomplish by attaching tools to Key Results and automating the goal tracking on the Key Results level by integrating with commonly used software tools in tech companies.

This project only reflects the proof of concept from the UI perspective, in the future, I might create the backend for this project.

## APP OVERVIEW

## 1. Objectives

Start by creating an objective with a start and end date, objective statement, and goal category

## 2. Key Results

Set Key Results related to your Objective, give them specific measurable metrics, and a measuable statement

## 3. Automate Your Key Results via Tools

Attach a Key Result with a software tool you would use to accomplish that goal and automate your efforts

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap
5. React
6. Redux

## REACT LIBRARIES USED

1. [React Moments](https://github.com/headzoo/react-moment#readme)
2. [React Date Picker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/)
3. [React BootStrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
4. [React Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/tree/v1.x)

## TESTING TOOLS

1. React Chrome Extension
2. Redux Chrome Extension
3. Chrome Dev Tools
4. Jest, Enzyme

## CHALLENGES

1. **Priority Management**: Figuring out which features are worth the time and core to product. Ex. decided to stimulate automated Key Results using a JSON file that stores software tool images
2. **Time Management**: Keeping app within 2 weeks scope
3. Focus: Dedicating more time on one particular skill, specifically, JavaScript over other technologies. Therefore, for styling and other features, delegate it to other libraries or frameworks.
4. **Ignorance and Inexperience**: Unsure of what actual technologies, time, and effort is needed to create an MVP that is sufficient for a proof of concept

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. _Database_: Add database to allow for unique user profiles
2. _Authentication_: To allow users to login via Google OAuth, etc
3. _3rd Party API Integration_: Build integration with IFTTT or Zapier to stimulate automating goals via integrated software tools
4. _Create Full Stack_: Build an actual backend
