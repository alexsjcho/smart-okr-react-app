## SMART OKRS (SOKR) MVP BACKSTORY

[Link to Live Demo App](https://github.com/alexsjcho/smart-okr-react-app)

This project was a start-up idea I had inspired by my work exerience at 15Five and IFTTT.

When I was introduced to OKRs at 15Five, it just made so much sense to me and resonated with my own goal-oriented personality.

Then, when I was introduced to the world of IoT technologies at IFTTT, I thought: what if, I could create a goal management software that integrates with all the popular software tools that tech companies regularly use like Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, etc and automate goal management?

The idea of SOKR was born to help automate goals through the everyday tools you use daily.

This is accomplish by attaching tools to Key Results and automating the goal tracking on the Key Results level by integrating with commonly used software tools in tech companies.

This project only reflects the proof of concept from the UI perspective, in the future, I might create the backend for this project.
